        <p><strong>Solaar</strong> is a Linux device manager for Logitech's <a href="http://logitech.com/en-us/66/6079">Unifying Receiver</a>
peripherals. It is able to pair/unpair devices to the receiver, and for most
devices read battery status.</p>

<p>It comes in two flavors, command-line and GUI.  Both are able to list the
devices paired to a Unifying Receiver, show detailed info for each device, and
also pair/unpair supported devices with the receiver.</p>

<h2>Supported Devices</h2>

<p><strong>Solaar</strong> will detect all devices paired with your Unifying Receiver, and at
the very least display some basic information about them.</p>

<p>For some devices, extra settings (usually not available through the standard
Linux system configuration) are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="http://logitech.com/product/k750-keyboard">K750 Solar Keyboard</a> is also queried for its solar charge status.
Pressing the <code>Solar</code> key on the keyboard will pop-up the application window
and display the current lighting value (Lux) as reported by the keyboard,
similar to Logitech's <em>Solar.app</em> for Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>The state of the <code>FN</code> key can be toggled on some keyboards (<a href="http://logitech.com/product/k750-keyboard">K750</a>,
<a href="http://logitech.com/product/wireless-illuminated-keyboard-k800">K800</a> and <a href="http://logitech.com/product/keyboard-k360">K360</a>). It changes the way the function keys
(<code>F1</code>..<code>F12</code>) work, i.e. whether holding <code>FN</code> while pressing the function keys
will generate the standard <code>Fx</code> keycodes or the special function (yellow
icons) keycodes.</p></li>
<li><p>The DPI can be changed on the <a href="http://logitech.com/product/performance-mouse-mx">Performance MX Mouse</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Smooth scrolling (higher sensitivity on vertical scrolling with the wheel) can
be toggled on the <a href="http://logitech.com/product/marathon-mouse-m705">M705 Marathon Mouse</a> and <a href="http://logitech.com/product/anywhere-mouse-mx">Anywhere MX Mouse</a>.</p></li>
</ul><p>Extended support for other devices may be added in the future, depending on the
documentation available, but the K750 keyboard and M705 mouse are the only
devices I have and can directly test on right now.</p>

<h2>Pre-built packages</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 12.04+ packages are available in my PPA: <a href="http://launchpad.net/%7Edaniel.pavel/+archive/solaar">ppa:daniel.pavel/Solaar</a>
</li>
<li>A downloadable Debian package for sid/unstable: <a href="http://pwr.github.com/Solaar/packages/solaar_0.8.6.2-1_all.deb">.deb</a>
</li>
<li>A <a href="http://code.r3pek.org/gentoo-overlay/src">Gentoo overlay</a> is available courtesy of Carlos Silva</li>
</ul><h2>Manual instalation</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>You should have a reasonably new kernel (3.2+), with the <code>logitech-djreceiver</code>
driver enabled and loaded; also, the <code>udev</code> package must be installed and the
daemon running.  If you have a modern Linux distribution (2011+), you're most
likely good to go.</p>

<p>The command-line application (<code>bin/solaar-cli</code>) requires Python 2.7.3 or 3.2+
(either version should work), and the <code>python-pyudev</code>/<code>python3-pyudev</code> package.</p>

<p>The GUI application (<code>bin/solaar</code>) also requires Gtk3, and its GObject
Introspection bindings. The Debian/Ubuntu package names are
<code>python-gi</code>/<code>python3-gi</code> and <code>gir1.2-gtk-3.0</code>; if you're using another
distribution the required packages are most likely named something similar.
If the desktop notifications bindings are also installed (<code>gir1.2-notify-0.7</code>),
you will also get desktop notifications when devices come online/go offline.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Normally USB devices are not accessible for r/w by regular users, so you will
need to do a one-time udev rule installation to allow access to the Logitech
Unifying Receiver.</p>

<p>You can run the <code>rules.d/install.sh</code> script from Solaar to do this installation
automatically (it will switch to root when necessary), or you can do all the
required steps by hand, as the root user:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>copy <code>rules.d/99-logitech-unfiying-receiver.rules</code> from Solaar to
<code>/etc/udev/rules.d/</code></p>

<p>By default, the rule makes the Unifying Receiver device available for r/w by
all users belonging to the <code>plugdev</code> system group (standard Debian/Ubuntu
group for pluggable devices). It may need changes, specific to your
particular system's configuration. If in doubt, replacing <code>GROUP="plugdev"</code>
with <code>GROUP="&lt;your username&gt;"</code> should just work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>run <code>udevadm control --reload-rules</code> to let the udev daemon know about the
new rule</p></li>
<li><p>physically remove the Unifying Receiver, wait 10 seconds and re-insert it</p></li>
</ol><h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Ubuntu's Unity indicators are not supported at this time. However, if you
whitelist 'Solaar' in the systray, you will get an icon (see
<a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/30742">Enable more icons to be in the system tray?</a> for details).</p></li>
<li><p>The application only looks at the first Unifying Receiver it finds, even if
there's more than one plugged in. Support for multiple receivers is in
progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Devices connected throught a <a href="http://logitech.com/mice-pointers/articles/5926">Nano Receiver</a> (which is very similar to
the Unifying Receiver) are not supported at this time.</p></li>
<li><p>Running the command-line application (<code>bin/solaar-cli</code>) while the GUI
application is also running <em>may</em> occasionally cause either of them to become
confused about the state of the devices. I haven't encountered this often
enough to be able to be able to diagnose it properly yet.</p></li>

<p>This project began as a third-hand clone of <a href="https://github.com/noah">Noah K. Tilton</a>'s
logitech-solar-k750 project on GitHub (no longer available). It was developed
further thanks to the diggings in Logitech's HID++ protocol done by many other
people:</p>

testing and supporting new devices.</p>
