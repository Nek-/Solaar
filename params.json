It is\r\nable to pair/unpair devices to the receiver, and for some devices read battery\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\nIt comes in two flavors, command-line and GUI.  Both are able to list the\r\ndevices paired to a Unifying Receiver, show detailed info for each device, and\r\nalso pair/unpair supported devices with the receiver.\r\n\r\n## Supported Devices\r\n\r\n**Solaar** will detect all devices paired with your Unifying Receiver, and at\r\nthe very least display some basic information about them.  Depending on the\r\ndevice, it may be able to read its battery status.\r\n\r\nA few devices also have extended support, mostly because I was able to directly\r\ntest on them:\r\n\r\n* The [K750 Solar Keyboard](http://www.logitech.com/keyboards/keyboard/devices/7454)\r\n  is also queried for its solar charge status. Pressing the Solar key on the\r\n  keyboard will pop-up the application window and display the current lighting\r\n  value (Lux) as reported by the keyboard, similar to Logitech's *Solar.app* for\r\n  Windows.\r\n\r\n  Also, you can change the way the function keys (`F1`..`F12`) work, i.e.\r\n  whether holding `FN` while pressing the function keys will generate the\r\n  standard keycodes or the special function (yellow icons) keycodes.\r\n\r\n* The [M705 Marathon Mouse](http://www.logitech.com/product/marathon-mouse-m705)\r\n  supports turning on/off Smooth Scrolling (higher sensitivity on vertical\r\n  scrolling with the wheel).\r\n\r\nExtended support for other devices may be added in the future, depending on the\r\ndocumentation available, but the K750 keyboard and M705 mouse are the only\r\ndevices I have and can test on right now.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nYou should have a reasonably new kernel (3.2+), with the `logitech-djreceiver`\r\ndriver enabled and loaded; also, the `udev` package must be installed and the\r\ndaemon running.  If you have a modern Linux distribution (2011+), you're most\r\nlikely good to go.\r\n\r\nThe command-line application (`bin/solaar-cli`) requires Python 2.7.3 or 3.2+\r\n(either version should work), and the `python-pyudev`/`python3-pyudev` package.\r\n\r\nThe GUI application (`bin/solaar`) also requires Gtk3, and its GObject\r\nIntrospection bindings. The Debian/Ubuntu package names are\r\n`python-gi`/`python3-gi` and `gir1.2-gtk-3.0`; if you're using another\r\ndistribution the required packages are most likely named something similar.\r\nIf the desktop notifications bindings are also installed (`gir1.2-notify-0.7`),\r\nyou will also get desktop notifications when devices come online/go offline.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nNormally USB devices are not accessible for r/w by regular users, so you will\r\nneed to do a one-time udev rule installation to allow access to the Logitech\r\nUnifying Receiver.\r\n\r\nYou can run the `rules.d/install.sh` script from Solaar to do this installation\r\nautomatically (it will switch to root when necessary), or you can do all the\r\nrequired steps by hand, as the root user:\r\n\r\n1. copy `rules.d/99-logitech-unfiying-receiver.rules` from Solaar to\r\n  `/etc/udev/rules.d/`\r\n\r\n  By default, the rule makes the Unifying Receiver device available for r/w by\r\n  all users belonging to the `plugdev` system group (standard Debian/Ubuntu\r\n  group for pluggable devices). It may need changes, specific to your\r\n  particular system's configuration. If in doubt, replacing `GROUP=\"plugdev\"`\r\n  with `GROUP=\"<your username>\"` should just work.\r\n\r\n2. run `udevadm control --reload-rules` to let the udev daemon know about the new\r\n  rule\r\n3. physically remove the Unifying Receiver, wait 10 seconds and re-insert it\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n- When running under Ubuntu's Unity, the tray icon will probably not appear, nor\r\n  will the application window.  Either run the application with the '-S' option,\r\n  or whitelist \"Solaar\" into the systray. For details, see\r\n  [How do I access and enable more icons to be in the system tray?](http://askubuntu.com/questions/30742/how-do-i-access-and-enable-more-icons-to-be-in-the-system-tray).\r\n\r\n  Support for Unity's indicators is a planned feature.\r\n\r\n- Running the command-line application (`bin/solaar-cli`) while the GUI\r\n  application is also running *may* occasionally cause either of them to become\r\n  confused about the state of the devices. I haven't encountered this often\r\n  enough to be able to be able to diagnose it properly yet.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nThis project began as a third-hand clone of [Noah K. Tilton](https://github.com/noah)'s\r\nlogitech-solar-k750 project on GitHub (no longer available). It was developed\r\nfurther thanks to the diggings in Logitech's HID++ protocol done by many other\r\npeople:\r\n\r\n- [Julien Danjou](http://julien.danjou.info/blog/2012/logitech-k750-linux-support),\r\nwho also provided some internal\r\n[Logitech documentation](http://julien.danjou.info/blog/2012/logitech-unifying-upower)\r\n- [Lars-Dominik Braun](http://6xq.net/git/lars/lshidpp.git)\r\n- [Alexander Hofbauer](http://derhofbauer.at/blog/blog/2012/08/28/logitech-performance-mx)\r\n- [Clach04](http://bitbucket.org/clach04/logitech-unifying-receiver-tools)\r\n\r\nAlso thanks to Douglas Wagner and Julien Gascard for helping with application\r\ntesting and supporting new devices.\r\n","name":"Solaar"}
